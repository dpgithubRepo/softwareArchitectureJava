Observer Pattern :


 --> Define one to many dependency. if state of one object changes all of its dependencies are notified automatically
 
 --> This helps to achieve loose coupling between the Objects
 
 --> The elements/objects are subject and observers. when the state of the subject is changed the observers are notified
 
 --> To add a new observer there is no need to change the subject code
